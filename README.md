# my_random_work
 Random coding I've done just for fun or to help myself.

Projects:
1. Hour Blocks
    - Description:
      - Right now it prints [('Special Diet', '48'), ('First Test', '24'), ('Second Test', '24')] to the terminal.
      - Later it will return a schedule based on input like what it is currently printing.
    - Relevant files:
      - hour_blocks.py
      - hour_blocks.txt
    - To run:
      - If you don't have Python installed, get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
      - Download both files & save them in the same folder.
      - Go to that folder in Command Prompt if using Windows (cd and then the file path).
      - Type 'python hour_blocks.py' without the 's and hit enter.
2. Unofficial SSI Calculator
    - Description:
      - Program asks for earned income for that month and returns an explanation for how it may impact SSI benefits
      - Program is very simple and does not take student status, SSDI, etc into account
    - Relevant files:
      - unofficial_ssi_calculator.py
    - To run:
      - If you don't have Python installed, get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

      - Enter '0' (zero) to exit the program.
